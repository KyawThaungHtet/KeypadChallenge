# Keypad Coding Challenge

This project is a solution to a coding challenge that simulates the behavior of an old phone keypad. It takes a string of keypresses as input and returns the corresponding letters based on how many times each key is pressed.

## Features
- Simulates keypresses on an old mobile phone keypad.
- Supports numbers 1-9, 0 (for space), and special characters like `#` and `*`.
- Handles multiple keypresses for a single key to return the correct letter.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
